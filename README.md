# TodoList
 This application uses HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, and JavaScript to manage tasks. Users can input tasks, which are added to a list with checkboxes for marking completion and delete icons for removal. A save button stores the tasks in local storage, ensuring they persist across page refreshes.
